Purpose
*******
The `Open edX Platform <https://openedx.org>`_ is a service-oriented platform for authoring and
delivering online learning at any scale.  The platform is written in
Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django
framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a
monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and
micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.

This repository hosts the monolith at the center of the Open edX
platform.  Functionally, the edx-platform repository provides two services:

* CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open edX Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and
* LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.

Installation
************

Installing and running an Open edX instance is not simple.  We strongly
recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you.  They
have free trials that make it easy to get started:
https://openedx.org/get-started/

If you will be modifying edx-platform code, the `Open edX Developer Stack`_ (Devstack) is
a Docker-based development environment.

If you want to run your own Open edX server and have the technical skills to do
so, `Open edX Installation Options`_ explains your options.
