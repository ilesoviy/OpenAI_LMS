CMS
===

This directory contains code relating to the Open edX Content Management System ("CMS"). It allows learning content to be created, edited, versioned, and eventually published to the `Open edX Learning Mangement System <../lms>`_ ("LMS"). The main user-facing application that CMS powers is the `Open edX Studio <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/getting_started/CA_get_started_Studio.html#>`_
