This config file follows the devstack enviroment, but adds the
requirement of a celery worker running in the background to process
celery tasks.

When testing locally, run lms/cms with this settings file as well, to test queueing
of tasks onto the appropriate workers.

In two separate processes on devstack:
    paver devstack studio --settings=devstack_with_worker
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=cms.envs.devstack_with_worker celery worker --app=cms.celery:APP
