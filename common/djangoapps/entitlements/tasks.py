    This task is designed to be called to process a bundle of entitlements
    that might be expired and confirm if we can do so. This is useful when
    checking if an entitlement has just been abandoned by the learner and needs
    to be expired. (In the normal course of a learner using the platform, the
    entitlement will expire itself. But if a learner doesn't log in... So we
    run this task every now and then to clear the backlog.)

        start (int): The beginning id in the database to examine
        end (int): The id in the database to stop examining at (i.e. range is exclusive)
