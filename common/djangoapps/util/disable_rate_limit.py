"""Utilities for disabling Django Rest Framework rate limiting.

This is useful for performance tests in which we need to generate
a lot of traffic from a particular IP address.  By default,
Django Rest Framework uses the IP address to throttle traffic
for users who are not authenticated.

To disable rate limiting:

1) Decorate the Django Rest Framework APIView with `@can_disable_rate_limit`
2) In Django's admin interface, set `RateLimitConfiguration.enabled` to False.

Note: You should NEVER disable rate limiting in production.

    The decorated function will first check model-based config
    to see if rate limiting is disabled; if so, it skips
    the throttle check.  Otherwise, it calls the original
    function to enforce rate-limiting.

    Arguments:
        func (function): The function to decorate.

    Returns:
        The decorated function.
