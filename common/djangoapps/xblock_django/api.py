def authorable_xblocks(allow_unsupported=False, name=None):
    """
    This method returns the QuerySet of XBlocks that can be created in Studio (by default, only fully supported
    and provisionally supported XBlocks), as stored in `XBlockStudioConfiguration`.
    Note that this method does NOT check the value `XBlockStudioConfigurationFlag`, nor does it take into account
    fully disabled xblocks (as returned by `disabled_xblocks`) or deprecated xblocks
    (as returned by `deprecated_xblocks`).

    Arguments:
        allow_unsupported (bool): If `True`, enabled but unsupported XBlocks will also be returned.
            Note that unsupported XBlocks are not recommended for use in courses due to non-compliance
            with one or more of the base requirements, such as testing, accessibility, internationalization,
            and documentation. Default value is `False`.
        name (str): If provided, filters the returned XBlocks to those with the provided name. This is
            useful for XBlocks with lots of template types.
    Returns:
        QuerySet: Returns authorable XBlocks, taking into account `support_level`, `enabled` and `name`
        (if specified) as specified by `XBlockStudioConfiguration`. Does not take into account whether or not
        `XBlockStudioConfigurationFlag` is enabled.
