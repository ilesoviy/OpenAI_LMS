    <h2>About ER22x</h2>
    
    <p>Justice is a critical analysis of classical and contemporary theories of justice, including discussion of present-day applications. Topics include affirmative action, income distribution, same-sex marriage, the role of markets, debates about rights (human rights and property rights), arguments for and against equality, dilemmas of loyalty in public and private life. The course invites students to subject their own views on these controversies to critical examination.</p>

<p>The assigned readings will be freely available online. They are also collected in an edited volume, <emph>Justice: A Reader</emph> (ed. Michael Sandel, Oxford University Press). Students who would like further guidance on the themes of the lectures can read Michael Sandel, <emph>Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?</emph>  (Recommended but not required.)

    <p>Yes, in several ways: </p>
    
    <ol>
<li><p> Each lecture invites you to respond to a poll question related to the themes of the lecture.  If you respond to the question, you will be presented with a challenge to the opinion you have expressed, and invited to reply to the challenge.  You can also, if you wish, comment on the opinions and responses posted by other students in the course, continuing the discussion.</p></li>

<li><p> In addition to the poll question, each class contains a discussion prompt that invites you to offer your view on a controversial question related to the lecture.
