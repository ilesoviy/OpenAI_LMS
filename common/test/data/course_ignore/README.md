IGNORING FILES

This course gets used to simulate imports of a course that include unnecessary files
inside the static assets directory, such as metadata files from Mac OS (filename starts with ._),
or backup files from an editor (filename ends with ~). These files do not belong with the content
so they should not be imported, and any existing instances should be removed.
