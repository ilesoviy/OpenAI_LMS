      <text>They are the ones who, at the public assembly, had put savage derangement [atē] into my thinking [phrenes] |89 on that day when I myself deprived Achilles of his honorific portion [geras]</text>
      <comment>Agamemnon says that atē or ‘derangement’ was the cause of his actions: why could Zeus say the same thing?</comment>
      <comment_prompt>Type your response below:</comment_prompt>
      <tag_prompt>In your answer to A) and considering the way atē or 'derangement' works in the Iliad as a whole, did you describe atē as:</tag_prompt>
      <options>
        <option choice="correct">atē - both a cause and an effect</option>
        <option choice="incorrect">atē - a cause</option>
        <option choice="partially-correct">atē - an effect</option>

  <solution>
    <p>If you answered “a cause,” you would be following the logic of the speaker, Agamemnon. But there is another logic at work here, and that is the superhuman logic that operates the cosmos. According to that logic, you have to look at the consequences of what you have done, not only the causes, and only then can you figure out the meaning of it all. If you answered “both a cause and an effect,” you would be reading out of the text in a more complete way. If you answered “an effect,” however, the reading would be less complete. Yes, you would still be reading out of the text, since the basic logic of the story is that a disaster happened. But it would be an incomplete reading, since the story is also about the need for explaining why the disaster happened.</p>
    <p>Going back to the answer “a cause,” the problem with this reading is that you would have simply taken Agamemnon’s words at face value. It is tempting, I admit, for us to see things the way Agamemnon sees things, since his world view in many ways resembles our own view of the Iliad when we read it for the very first time. Agamemnon is saying: I made a mistake, but it is not my fault, since a god made me do it. In Homeric poetry, we too see the gods intervening in the lives of humans. Yes, but we also see humans making their own free choices. If we forget about the free choice of Agamemnon, then we are simply reading into the text and not paying full attention to what the text says in its entirety.</p>
