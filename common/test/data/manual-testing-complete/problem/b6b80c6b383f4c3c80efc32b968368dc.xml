<problem display_name="Math Expression Input" markdown="null">
  <p>
A math expression input problem accepts a line of text representing a mathematical expression from the
student, and evaluates the input for equivalence to a mathematical expression provided by the 
grader. Correctness is based on numerical sampling of the symbolic expressions.
</p>
  <p>
The answer is correct if both the student provided response and the grader's mathematical
expression are equivalent to specified numerical tolerance, over a specified range of values for each
variable.
</p>
  <p>This kind of response checking can handle symbolic expressions, but places an extra burden
on the problem author to specify the allowed variables in the expression, and the
numerical ranges over which the variables must be sampled in order to test for correctness.</p>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The mathematical summary of many of the theory of relativity developed by Einstein is that the amount of energy contained in a mass m is the mass time the speed of light squared.</p>
      <p>As you can see with the formula entry, the answer is \(\frac{R_1*R_2}{R_3}\)</p>
