This course fixture provides a representative sample of scoreable block types.

## Contents of the Course

It contains several scoreable blocks in one sequence:

- CAPA
- ORA
- SGA (Staff Graded Assignment)
- LTI
- LTI Consumer
- Randomized Content Block (containing Library Content with CAPA problems)
- Drag and Drop (v2)

## Adding Blocks

To expand coverage to other block types, you can either edit the course xml
directly, or do the following:

1. Zip up the scoreable directory into a tarball:

    $ tar cvzf course.tar.gz common/test/data/scoreable'

2. Import the tarball into studio.
3. Add the new blocks.
4. Export the modified course.
5. Unzip to a temporary directory:

    $ cd /tmp
    $ tar xvzf ~/Downloads/course.*.tar.gz
    $ somewhere, and

6. Copy the data back into the test directory:

    $ rsync -avz --delete-after /tmp/course/ /path/to/edx-platform/common/test/data/scoreable

## Use in Tests

As of this writing, this course is used in
`lms/djangoapps/grades/tests/test_new.py`  If you modify the course, you may
need to adjust the values for `SCORED_BLOCK_COUNT` and `ACTUAL_TOTAL_POSSIBLE`
in `TestMultipleProblemBlockTypes` to reflect the real number of scoreable
blocks.
