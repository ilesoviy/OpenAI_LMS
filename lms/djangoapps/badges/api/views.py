class UserBadgeAssertions(generics.ListAPIView):
    """
    **Use Cases**

        Request a list of assertions for a user, optionally constrained to a course.

    **Example Requests**

        GET /api/badges/v1/assertions/user/{username}/

    **Response Values**

        Body comprised of a list of objects with the following fields:

        * badge_class: The badge class the assertion was awarded for. Represented as an object
          with the following fields:
            * slug: The identifier for the badge class
            * issuing_component: The software component responsible for issuing this badge.
            * display_name: The display name of the badge.
            * course_id: The course key of the course this badge is scoped to, or null if it isn't scoped to a course.
            * description: A description of the award and its significance.
            * criteria: A description of what is needed to obtain this award.
            * image_url: A URL to the icon image used to represent this award.
        * image_url: The baked assertion image derived from the badge_class icon-- contains metadata about the award
          in its headers.
        * assertion_url: The URL to the OpenBadges BadgeAssertion object, for verification by compatible tools
          and software.

    **Params**

        * slug (optional): The identifier for a particular badge class to filter by.
        * issuing_component (optional): The issuing component for a particular badge class to filter by
          (requires slug to have been specified, or this will be ignored.) If slug is provided and this is not,
          assumes the issuing_component should be empty.
        * course_id (optional): Returns assertions that were awarded as part of a particular course. If slug is
          provided, and this field is not specified, assumes that the target badge has an empty course_id field.
          '*' may be used to get all badges with the specified slug, issuing_component combination across all courses.

    **Returns**

        * 200 on success, with a list of Badge Assertion objects.
        * 403 if a user who does not have permission to masquerade as
          another user specifies a username other than their own.
        * 404 if the specified user does not exist
