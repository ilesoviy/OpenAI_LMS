    A nested transformer of the UserPartitionTransformer that honors the
    block structure pathways created by split_test blocks.

    To avoid code duplication, the implementation transforms its block
    access representation to the representation used by user_partitions.
    Namely, the 'group_id_to_child' field on a split_test block is
    transformed into the, now standard, 'group_access' fields in the
    split_test block's children.

    The implementation therefore relies on the UserPartitionTransformer
    to actually enforce the access using the 'user_partitions' and
    'group_access' fields.
