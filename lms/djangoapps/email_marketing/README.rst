If you are reading this and the 'Maple' Open edX release is out, you can safely delete
this whole djangoapp. It only exists to hold old model migrations and any post-Maple
installation will no longer have any model in the database for this app.

But for some minor historical context, this djangoapp used to hold some integration
with sailthru that we no longer needed.
