Responsibilities
================

The grades app is responsible for computing and storing learners' grades in Course Runs. It provides Python and REST
APIs for retrieving, updating, and managing learners' grades.

The grades app is intended *only* for code related to the core grades subsystem. Any feature (even if it's a grades-related feature) built on top of the core grades subsystem does *not* belong here.

Direction: Keep
