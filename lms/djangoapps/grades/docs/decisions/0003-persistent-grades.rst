Persistent Subsection and Course Grades
---------------------------------------

Status
======

Accepted (circa June 2017)

Context
=======

There are several reasons that we need to persist a learner's computed grade in the database,
both at the subsection-level, course-level and problem-level.  Prior to the introduction
of persistent subsection and course grades, only problem-level grades were persisted, with
higher-level grades computed dynamically from these problem grades.

Decisions
=========

More background and the decisions around persistent subsection and course grades
are captured in the `Robust Grades Document
<https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDUCATOR/pages/95912121/Robust+Grades+Design>`_.
