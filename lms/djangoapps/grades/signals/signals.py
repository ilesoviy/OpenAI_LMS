# Signal that indicates that a user's raw score for a problem has been updated.
# This signal is generated when a scoring event occurs within the core
# platform. Note that this signal will be triggered
# regardless of the new and previous values of the score (i.e. it may be the
# case that this signal is generated when a user re-attempts a problem but
# receives the same score).

# Signal that indicates that a user's weighted score for a problem has been updated.
