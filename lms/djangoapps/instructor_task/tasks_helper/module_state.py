    """
    Performs generic update by visiting StudentModule instances with the update_fcn provided.

    The student modules are fetched for update the `update_fcn` is called on each StudentModule
    that passes the resulting filtering. It is passed four arguments:  the block for
    the module pointed to by the module_state_key, the particular StudentModule to update, the
    xblock_instance_args, and the task_input being passed through.  If the value returned by the
    update function evaluates to a boolean True, the update is successful; False indicates the update
    on the particular student module failed.
    A raised exception indicates a fatal condition -- that no other student modules should be considered.

    The return value is a dict containing the task's results, with the following keys:

          'attempted': number of attempts made
          'succeeded': number of attempts that "succeeded"
          'skipped': number of attempts that "skipped"
          'failed': number of attempts that "failed"
          'total': number of possible updates to attempt
          'action_name': user-visible verb to use in status messages.  Should be past-tense.
              Pass-through of input `action_name`.
          'duration_ms': how long the task has (or had) been running.

    Because this is run internal to a task, it does not catch exceptions.  These are allowed to pass up to the
    next level, so that it can set the failure modes and capture the error trace in the InstructorTask and the
    result object.
