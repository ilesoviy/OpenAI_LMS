Responsibilities
================

This Django app hosts dashboard pages used by edX learners. The intent is for
this Django app to include the following dashboard tabs:

 - Courses
 - Programs

Direction: Deprecate
====================
This is being replaced by new UI that is in active development.  New functionality should not be added here.

Glossary

Courses
-------

The learner-facing dashboard listing active and archived enrollments. The
current implementation of the dashboard resides in
``common/djangoapps/student/``.

Programs

A page listing programs in which the learner is engaged. The page also shows
learners' progress towards completing the programs. Programs are structured
collections of course runs which culminate into a certificate.
