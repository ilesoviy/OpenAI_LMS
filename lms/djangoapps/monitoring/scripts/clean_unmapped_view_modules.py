"""
Provided a CSV of data from our monitoring system, this script outputs a unique and clean
set of apps of unmapped view_func_modules.

Context: This script was useful when first introducing ownership mapping and we had many
apps from 3rd-party dependencies that were missed. At this point, we'd probably only
expect 0-2 new unmapped apps, which could be cleaned manually very quickly without this
script.

Sample usage::

    python lms/djangoapps/monitoring/scripts/clean_unmapped_view_modules.py --unmapped-csv "unmapped-apps.csv"

Or for more details::

    python lms/djangoapps/monitoring/scripts/clean_unmapped_view_modules.py --help
