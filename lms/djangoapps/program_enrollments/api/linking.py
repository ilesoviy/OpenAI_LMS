    Utility function to link ProgramEnrollments to LMS Users

    Arguments:
        -program_uuid: the program for which we are linking program enrollments
        -external_keys_to_usernames: dict mapping `external_user_keys` to LMS usernames.

    Returns: dict[str: str]
        Map from external keys to errors, for the external keys of users whose
        linking produced errors.

    Raises: ValueError if None is included in external_keys_to_usernames

    This function will look up program enrollments and users, and update the program
    enrollments with the matching user. If the program enrollment has course enrollments, we
    will enroll the user into their waiting program courses.

    For each external_user_key:lms_username, if:
        - The user is not found
        - No enrollment is found for the given program and external_user_key
        - The enrollment already has a user and that user is the same as the given user
    An error message will be logged, and added to a dictionary of error messages keyed by
    external_key. The input will be skipped. All other inputs will be processed and
    enrollments updated, and then the function will return the dictionary of error messages.

    For each external_user_key:lms_username, if the enrollment already has a user, but that user
    is different than the requested user, we do the following. We unlink the existing user from
    the program enrollment and link the requested user to the program enrollment. This is accomplished by
    removing the existing user's link to the program enrollment. If the program enrollment
    has course enrollments, then we unenroll the user. If there is an audit track in the course,
    we also move the enrollment into the audit track. We also remove the association between those
    course enrollments and the program course enrollments. The
    requested user is then linked to the program following the above logic.

    If there is an error while enrolling a user in a waiting program course enrollment, the
    error will be logged, and added to the returned error dictionary, and we will roll back all
    transactions for that user so that their db state will be the same as it was before this
    function was called, to prevent program enrollments to be in a state where they have an LMS
    user but still have waiting course enrollments. All other inputs will be processed
    normally.
