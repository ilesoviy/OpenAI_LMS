## This template is for track selection with partial or no Feature Based
## Enrollment (FBE). In other words, it is un-FBE. FBE is when the learner in
## the default audit track has a limited time to complete the course (course
## access duration) and has some of the content of the course unavailable (gated
## content). This template covers un-FBE, which is when the learner is subject
## to either: (1) gated content but not course access duration; (2) course
## access duration but not gated content; or (3) neither gated content nor
## course access duration.
