This is the root package for all core Open edX functionality. In particular,
the djangoapps subpackage is the location for all Django apps that are shared
between LMS and CMS.

Note: the majority of the core functionality currently lives in the root
common directory. All new Django apps should be created here instead, and
the pre-existing apps will be moved here over time.
