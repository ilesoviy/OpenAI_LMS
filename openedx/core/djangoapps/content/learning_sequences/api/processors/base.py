    """
    Base class for manipulating the Course Outline.

    You can inherit from this class and extend any of its four main methods:
    __init__, load_data, inaccessible_sequences, usage_keys_to_remove.

    An OutlineProcessor is invoked synchronously during a request for the
    CourseOutline. The steps are:
        * __init__
        * load_data
        * inaccessible_sequences, usage_keys_to_remove (no ordering guarantee)

    Also note that you should not assume any ordering relative to any other
    OutlineProcessor. Once async support works its way fully into Django, we'll
    likely even want to run these in parallel.

    Some outline processors (like ScheduleOutlineProcessor) may choose to have
    additional methods to return specific metadata to feed into
    UserCourseOutlineDetailsData.
