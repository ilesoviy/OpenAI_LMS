        Read-only serializer for CourseOutlineData for this endpoint.

        This serializer was purposefully declared inline with the
        CourseOutlineView to discourage reuse/magic. Our goal is to make it
        extremely obvious how things are being serialized, and not have surprise
        regressions because a shared serializer in another module was modified
        to fix an issue in one of its three use cases.

        The data structures in api/data.py send back try to separate the data by
        lifecycle (e.g. CourseOutlineData vs UserCourseOutlineData) and by
        logical system (e.g. ScheduleData) to promote performance and
        pluggability. But for the REST API, we're just trying to collapse those
        into the simplest, most convenient output possible.

        We also remove any references to "usage_keys" at this layer. UsageKeys
        are a critical part of the internals of edx-platform, so the in-process
        API uses them, but we translate them to "ids" for REST API clients.
