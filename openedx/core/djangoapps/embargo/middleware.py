"""Middleware for embargoing site and courses.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This code WILL NOT WORK if you have a misconfigured proxy
server.  If you are configuring embargo functionality, or if you are
experiencing mysterious problems with embargoing, please check that your
reverse proxy is setting any of the well known client IP address headers (ex.,
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR).

This middleware allows you to:

* Embargoing courses (access restriction by courses)
* Embargoing site (access restriction of the main site)

Embargo can restrict by states and whitelist/blacklist (IP Addresses
(ie. 10.0.0.0), Networks (ie. 10.0.0.0/24)), or the user profile country.

Usage:

1) Enable embargo by setting `settings.FEATURES['EMBARGO']` to True.

2) In Django admin, create a new `IPFilter` model to block or whitelist
    an IP address from accessing the site.

3) In Django admin, create a new `RestrictedCourse` model and
    configure a whitelist or blacklist of countries for that course.
