    """Simulate that a course is restricted.

    This does two things:
    1) Configures country access rules so that the course is restricted.
    2) Mocks the GeoIP call so the user appears to be coming
        from a country that's blocked from the course.

    This is useful for tests that need to verify
    that restricted users won't be able to access
    particular views.

    Arguments:
        course_key (CourseKey): The location of the course to block.

    Keyword Arguments:
        access_point (str): Either "courseware" or "enrollment"

    Yields:
        str: A URL to the page in the embargo app that explains
            why the user was blocked.

    Example Usage:
    >>> with restrict_course(course_key) as redirect_url:
    >>>     # The client will appear to be coming from
    >>>     # an IP address that is blocked.
    >>>     resp = self.client.get(url)
    >>>     self.assertRedirects(resp, redirect_url)
