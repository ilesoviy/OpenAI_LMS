Responsibilities
================
The external_user_ids app links ids to a user. The internal database id
associated with a user may not be appropriate to send outside of Open edX, so
this app contains external ids for users.

This app can link an internal user id to an external user id of a particular
type, and can also link an external user id to an internal id (and thus to a
particular user).

Intended responsibility: Management of ids associated with a user.
