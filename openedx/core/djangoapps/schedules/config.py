    Returns and stores whether a user should be getting the "external course updates" experience.

    See the description of this experiment with the waffle flag definition above. But basically, if a user is getting
    external course updates for a course, edx-platform just stops sending any updates, trustingn that the user is
    receiving them elsewhere.

    This is basically just a wrapper around our experiment waffle flag, but only buckets users that directly enrolled
    (rather than users enrolled by staff), for technical "waffle-flags-can-only-get-the-user-from-the-request" reasons.

    This saves the decision in experiment data tables. It is also idempotent and will not change after the first
    call for a given user/course, regardless of how the waffle answer changes.
