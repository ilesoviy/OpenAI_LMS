"""
Take the list of states from settings.RETIREMENT_STATES and forces the
RetirementState table to mirror it.

We use a foreign keyed table for this instead of just using the settings
directly to generate a `choices` tuple for the model because the states
need to be configurable by open source partners and modifying the
`choices` for a model field causes new migrations to be generated,
with a variety of unpleasant follow-on effects for the partner when
upgrading the model at a later date.
