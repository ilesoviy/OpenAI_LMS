Status: Maintenance

Responsibilities
================
The ``user_authn`` app contains user authentication related features such as login, registration, and credential management.

Direction: Extract
==================
Ideally this would be in its own service, but at this point, LMS is the home of all authentication related features.

At this time, these features are still plugged into Studio. Future clean-up in Studio is intended to make this an LMS only feature.
