        Create a custom UserPartition to support dynamic groups.

        A Partition has an id, name, scheme, description, parameters, and a list

        are used. (e.g., for partitions of users within a course, the ids should
        be unique per-course). The scheme is used to assign users into groups.
        The parameters field is used to save extra parameters e.g., location of
        the course ID for this partition scheme.

        Partitions can be marked as inactive by setting the "active" flag to False.
