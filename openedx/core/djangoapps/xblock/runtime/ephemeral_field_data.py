"""
An :class:`~xblock.runtime.KeyValueStore` that stores data in the django cache

This is used for low-priority ephemeral student state data:
* Anonymous users browsing and previewing content
* Studio authors testing out XBlocks

We could also store this data in django sessions, but its a bit tricky to access
session data during any requests which don't have any cookies or other normal
authentication mechanisms (like XBlock handler calls from within XBlock <iframe>
sandboxes). And keeping this storage completely separate from django session
data and registered user XBlock state reduces the potential for security
problems. We expect the data in this store to be low-value and free of
personally identifiable information (PII) so if some security bug results in one
user accessing a different user's entries in this particular store, it's not a
big deal.
