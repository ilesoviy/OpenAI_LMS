"""
This module contains generic generator functions for traversing tree
(and DAG) structures.  It is agnostic to the underlying data structure
and implementation of the tree object.  It does this through dependency
injection of the tree's accessor functions: get_parents and
get_children.

The following depth-first traversal methods are implemented:

* Pre-order: Parent yielded before children; child with multiple
parents is yielded when first encountered.

    Example use cases (when DAGs are *not* supported):

        1. User access. If computing a user's access to a node relies
            on the user's access to the node's parents, access to the
            parent has to be computed before access to the child can
            be determined. To support access chains, a user's access on
            a node is actually an accumulation of accesses down from the
            root node through the ancestor chain to the actual node.

        2. Field value percolated down. If a value for a field is
            dependent on a combination of the child's and the parent's
            value, the parent's value should be computed before that of
            the child's. Similar to "User access", the value would be
            percolated down through the entire ancestor chain.

            Example: Start Date is
                max(node's start date, start date of each ancestor)
            This takes the most restrictive value.

        3. Depth. When computing the depth of a tree, since a child's
            depth value is 1 + the parent's depth value, the parent's
            value should be computed before the child's.

        4. Fast Subtree Deletion. If the tree is to be pruned during
            traversal, an entire subtree can be deleted, without
            traversing the children, as soon as the parent is determined
            to be deleted.

* Topological: Parent yielded before children; child with multiple
parents yielded only after all its parents are visited.

    Example use cases (when DAGs *are* supported):

        1. User access. Similar to pre-order, except a user's access
            is now determined by taking a *union* of the percolated
            access value from each of the node's parents combined with
            its own access.

        2. Field value percolated down. Similar to pre-order, except the
            value for a node is calculated from the array of
            percolated values from each of its parents combined
            with its own.

            Example: Start Date is
                max(node's start date, min(max(ancestry of each parent))
            This takes the most permissive from all ancestry chains.

        3. Depth. Similar to pre-order, except the depth of a node will
            be 1 + the minimum (or the maximum depending on semantics)
            of the depth of all its parents.

        4. Deletion. Deletion of subtrees are not as fast as they are
            for pre-order since a node can be accessed through multiple
            parents.

* Post-order: Children yielded before its parents.

    Example use cases:

        1. Counting. When each node wants to count the number of nodes
            within its sub-structure, the count for each child has to be
            calculated before its parents, since a parent's value
            depends on its children.

        2. Map function (when order doesn't matter). If a function
            needs to be evaluated for each node in a DAG and the order
            that the nodes are iterated doesn't matter, then use
            post-order since it is faster than topological for DAGs.

        3. Field value percolated up. If a value for a field is based
            on the value from it's children, the children's values need
            to be computed before their parents.

            Example: Minimum Due Date of all nodes within the
            sub-structure.

Note: In-order traversal is not implemented as of yet.  We can do so
if/when needed.

Optimization once DAGs are not supported:
Supporting Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) requires us to use
topological sort, which has the following negative performance
implications:

* For a simple tree, we can immediately skip over traversing
descendants, once it is determined that a parent is not to be yielded
(based on the return value from the 'filter_func' function). However,
since we support DAGs, we cannot simply skip over descendants since
they may still be accessible through a different ancestry chain and
need to be revisited once all their parents are visited.

* For topological sort, we need the get_parents accessor function in
order to determine whether all of a node's parents have been visited.
This means the underlying implementation of the graph needs to have
an efficient way to get a node's parents, perhaps with back pointers
to each node's parents.  This requires additional storage space, which
could be eliminated if DAGs are not supported.
