def assert_event_matches(expected, actual, tolerate=None):
    """
    Compare two event dictionaries.

    Fail if any discrepancies exist, and output the list of all discrepancies. The intent is to produce clearer
    error messages than "{ some massive dict } != { some other massive dict }", instead enumerating the keys that
    differ. Produces period separated "paths" to keys in the output, so "context.foo" refers to the following
    structure:

        {
            'context': {
                'foo': 'bar'  # this key, value pair
            }
        }

    The other key difference between this comparison and `assertEquals` is that it supports differing levels of
    tolerance for discrepancies. We don't want to litter our tests full of exact match tests because then anytime we
    add a field to all events, we have to go update every single test that has a hardcoded complete event structure in
    it. Instead we support making partial assertions about structure and content of the event. So if I say my expected
    event looks like this:

        {
            'event_type': 'foo.bar',
            'event': {
                'user_id': 10
            }
        }

    This method will raise an assertion error if the actual event either does not contain the above fields in their
    exact locations in the hierarchy, or if it does contain them but has different values for them. Note that it will
    *not* necessarily raise an assertion error if the actual event contains other fields that are not listed in the
    expected event. For example, the following event would not raise an assertion error:

        {
            'event_type': 'foo.bar',
            'referer': 'http://example.com'
            'event': {
                'user_id': 10
            }
        }

    Note that the extra "referer" field is not considered an error by default.

    The `tolerate` parameter takes a set that allows you to specify varying degrees of tolerance for some common
    eventing related issues. See the `EventMatchTolerates` class for more information about the various flags that are
    supported here.

    Example output if an error is found:

        Unexpected differences found in structs:

        * <path>: not found in actual
        * <path>: <expected_value> != <actual_value> (expected != actual)

        Expected:
            { <expected event }

        Actual:
            { <actual event> }

    "<path>" is a "." separated string indicating the key that differed. In the examples above "event.user_id" would
    refer to the value of the "user_id" field contained within the dictionary referred to by the "event" field in the
    root dictionary.
