Survey Report
--------------------
This Django app was created for the purpose of gathering aggregated, anonymized data
about Open edX courses at scale, so that we can begin to track the growth
and trends in Open edX usage over time, namely in the annual Open edX
Impact Report.

You could find in this directory some methods to manage survey
reports, one command to generate the report, some queries to get the
information from database and one method to send the report to openedx
api.
