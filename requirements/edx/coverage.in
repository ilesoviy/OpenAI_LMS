# Dependencies that are used solely for calculating test coverage.
# These are split out so that if you are only calculating coverage
# then you don't need to install all the rest of the prereqs.
#
# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
