# Enhance a JWK to have all of its optional performance parameters.
# Intended to be used on an RSA `JWT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_JWK`.
#
# This is needed for the change from pyjwkest to PyJWT, since the
# former accepts a partial list of optional parameters but the latter
# requires that they are either all present or all absent. The optional
# parameters provide a performance boost.
#
# Usage: Key JSON accepted on stdin; enhanced key printed to stdout.
