## XBlocks count script

The script in this directory, xblock_counts.py, when run will produce 2 csv files containing a summary
of the XBlock usage in courses.

This script requires a list of XBlock types. The xblock_studio_configuration.json file included is an example. The file
contains a list of types for the tool to summarize with counts.

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "problem",
    },
    {
      "name": "video",
    },
    ...
  ]
}

### Steps for usage

1. Ensure all python requirements are up to date including those listed in the requirements.txt file.

2. Request a OAUTH2_Client ID on the api platform you are querying.
