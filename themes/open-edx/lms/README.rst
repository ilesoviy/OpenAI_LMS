LMS Open edX Theme
##################

This is the default LMS theme used by Open edX installations. It doesn't
provide any overrides, which means that it adopts the built-in themes,
templates etc.

The `Red Theme`_ is provided as an example of building a simple new theme.

For more information on building your own theme, see `Changing Themes for an Open edX Site`_.
